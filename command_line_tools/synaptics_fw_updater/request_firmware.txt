Firmware Update Function
========================

Call exporting function "synaptics_fw_updater" in rmi_fw_update.c to start
firmware updating process in the driver.

The RMI4 driver uses the kernel's request_firmware() feature to obtain
firmware for the touch sensor.  The firmware is expected to live in
the file firmware/<firmware_name>.img.ihex.

To prepare Synaptics provided .img file for reflashing, convert it to .ihex
format using the following command:

    objcopy -I binary -O ihex <firmware_name>.img firmware/<firmware_name>.img.ihex

Then make sure to add the image file name to the
CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_RMI4_FW_UPDATE entry in firmware/Makefile.
If you don't do this, the image file won't be included, and
the firmware loader class will delay for 60 seconds waiting for a non-existent
userspace response to the firmware load request.

Firmware updates for multichip solutions (aka LTS) are not supported.
